# Sort Chest

Organize your chest instantly with a single click

This mod added several buttons in chest GUI.

- **Sort:** sort items by id, metadata, and quantity.
- **Refill:** move same items (between chest and inventory) to chest.
- **Fill:** move items from inventory to chest.
- **Dump:** move items from chest to inventory.

> **Important**
> - Required [Babric](https://github.com/Turnip-Labs/babric-instance-repo/releases) to run the mod.  
> - Required [HalpLibe](https://github.com/Turnip-Labs/bta-halplibe/releases) in BTA version 7.1 and later.

## FAQ

### Server?

**Yes**, you can use the sort chest mod on a server. However, the item might jump for a while after sorting because the
mod will emulate mouse clicks rather than directly changing the inventory data.

### Rebind keys?

1. Open the mod menu (from [ModMenu](https://github.com/Turnip-Labs/ModMenu) mod)
2. Select "Sort Chest" mod from the left
3. Click at ⚙️ icon on the right
4. Rebind keys that you want

### How does the sort chest mod sort items?

Items are sorted by their item ID (ascending), followed by its metadata (like wool color code, ascending), and finally
by its quantity (descending).
